      <description>One of PostgreSQL features that I had the most trouble getting my head around was the use of WITH RECURSION, particularly due to the fact that this type of recursion doesn&amp;rsquo;t resemble any of the examples of this concept that I had previously encountered. Even Postgres&amp;rsquo; documentation aknowledges this:
 Strictly speaking, this process is iteration not recursion, but RECURSIVE is the terminology chosen by the SQL standards committee.
 Let&amp;rsquo;s look at an example to see what we are talking about.</description>

# Working on

- Why interfaces are your friends (persistence Adapters on socket.io
	and casbin) example of my rabbit class
- Inheritance and Annotations to configure a DDD presentation layer
- Extensibility in Go: methods that extend a struct and allow it to
	conform to a library by implementing an interface, i.e. `Write()` or
	`ServeHTTP`, (akin to annotations?)


- DSL and AST for code generation. Simplify complexity by generating
	code, an intermediate layer, not run-time compilation.
	Source-to-source compiler


- an interface is a machine that manufactures behavior


- Example use case of async generators
- Another take on generics
- RabbitMQ reconnection logic

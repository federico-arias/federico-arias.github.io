## Intro

Hypothesis testing with the following statistical tests:


1. z-test for percentages
2. z-test for population means

3. z-test for difference of percentages
4. z-test for pooled difference of population means
5. z-test for difference of paired population means

6. Chi-squared test for goodness of fit
7. Regression t-test


This is what varies 
* Dependent or independent
* Small or big sample
* Percentages or means
* With or without replacement
* Pooled or not pooled 

## Shape of data 

```{r eval=T, echo=T}
xbar <- 9900            # sample mean 
mu0 <- 10000            # hypothesized value 
sigma <- 120            # population standard deviation 
```

```{r echo=FALSE, results= "asis"}
library('pander')
pandoc.table(head(iris[, 1:3]), style="rmarkdown")
# this is to display a table 
```

$$\frac{\overline{x}-\mu_0}{\sigma\sqrt{n}}$$

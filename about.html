<p>My name is {{ site.author.name }}. I'm a Full-Stack Web Developer and Instructional Designer. </p> 

<p>I'm currently writing my M. Ed. thesis, so most of the topics in this site have to do with that. Specifically:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Self-regulated learning assisted by computers.</li>
    <li>Open-source tools for academic research.</li>
    <li>Workflow scaffolding and knowledge management.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am also interested in web design; particulary, in the areas of information architecture, usability and information visualization.</p>

<p>I made this site with Jekyll and a customized theme.</p>

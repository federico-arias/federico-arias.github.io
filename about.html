<p>I am {{ site.author.name }}. I'm an Instructional Designer and occasional Web Developer. </p> 

<p>I'm currently writing my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Education">M. Ed.</a> thesis, so most of the topics in this site have to do with that. Specifically, I'm interested in researching about:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Self-regulated learning assisted by computers.</li>
    <li>Open-source tools for academic research.</li>
    <li>Workflow scaffolding and knowledge management.</li>
    <li>Linked Data and the Semantic Web.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am also interested in web design; particulary, in the areas of information architecture, usability and information visualization.</p>

<p>I made this site with Jekyll and a customized theme.</p>

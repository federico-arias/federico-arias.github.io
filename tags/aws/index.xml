      <description>The solution proposed was a single-page application that relied on a Postgres database for persistence.
FrontEnd One of the challenges of the project was coordinating the work between two front-end developers while I developed the backend and part of the front-end. To this purpose, we used Apiary to simulate a REST API interaction. Then, we just swapped Apiary&amp;rsquo;s URI with our backend.
I discovered Nir Kaufman&amp;rsquo;s design patterns, and decided to try them out, ditching redux-thunk in favor of middlewares.</description>

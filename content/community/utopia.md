The contemporary critiques of capitalism, whether in the shape of deep
ecology, minimalism, or hippie new age spiritualism, all share varying
amounts of anti-industralization. Can a truly emancipatory politics
dispense with the productivity of labor afforded by mass production? Are the
benefits of industrial production inseparable from its disadvantages?

Anti-industralization is nothing new. It is almost as old as
industralization itself. Anarcho-primitivists, the Luddite movement in
the 19th century and hippies in the 20th century all have erected
arguments against the effects of the transformation of agrarian
societies into mass societies.

Some notes:

* Most of these arguments agree with the Marxist diagnostic, pointing
	out the ills of division of labor, the explotation of nature and
	worker's alienation. But, while Marx notes the revolutionary
	potential in the modification of consciousness brought about
	by this mode of production, the anti-industralization discourse
	insists on going back to a previous idealized state.

* The majority of these arguments ignore the existence of [domestic
	unpaid work]. They idealize the available leisure time by
	discarding care work and domestic labor.

* Are consumerism, the exploitation of nature, overproduction, and
	large-scale, impersonal, social institutions a neccesary product
	of all forms of industrialization? Can we differenciate the
	increase in the productivity of labor from the evils of
	mass society?

* Is primitivism the only way to attain self-sufficiency? Are they
	really?

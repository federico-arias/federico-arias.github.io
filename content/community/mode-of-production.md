# Ideas
- specific modes of production not only condition the perception of
	labour, but also the social relations
- owning the means of production is not enough if the rationale that
	drives the production of goods is still profit.
- the goods themselves should be put into question, the materials by
	which those products are made

## pop critiques of the capitalist mode of production

- anarcho-primitivism critizes the wrong aspects of the industrial
	mode of production.
- minimalism misses the point of industrial overproduction and
	overconsumption. It is right, but for the wrong reasons
- hippie communes are most of the time ancillary to the capitalist
	mode of production and are only part of the entertainment or
	leisure industries (non autonomous relation to Capital)
- permaculture

##

- different form of organizing production: cooperatives
- non accounted goals to re-organize the mode of production:
	democratization of decision-making, autonomy. To what extent these
	goals are considered in the production of goods?
- accounted goals modifying the mode of production: cooperatives,
	sustainability, equal-pay

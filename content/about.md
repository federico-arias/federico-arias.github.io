I am Federico Arias, a **full-stack developer** based

## Work Experience (abridged)

	automated deployment in multiple environments.

	architecture centered around RabbitMQ.
* Standardized good practices (GitFlow, 12Factor, Reactive Manifesto,
	DDD, TDD) in both back and front-end teams.

	Go, Postgres and Redis, and React/Redux in the front-end.

## This website

This site was built with a custom-made template for [Hugo][2].
You can find it [here in my GitHub][github] along with other projects.

## Social media

If I stumble upon any interesting article, it'll probably
end up on my [Twitter feed][1].  I also contribute to [StackOverflow][so]
sparingly.

I head a small foundation to foster **sustainable building practices**
with the aim of strengthening community development, so you might find posts
about this topic in the future.

title: "About me"
---

I am Federico Arias Recabarren, a freelance **full-stack developer** based on Latin America. I have experience working with the following tools:

* Javascript (d3.js, React)
* Git
* Docker
* Scala
* Vim

I also head a foundation to foster **sustainable building practices** with the aim of strengthening communal spaces, so you might find posts about both of these topics intertwined here.

This site was built with [Hugo][2] and a custom-made template.

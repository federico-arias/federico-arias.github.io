I am Federico Arias, a freelance **full-stack developer** based on Latin America. I have experience working with the following tools:

* **Front**: Javascript (d3.js, React, Node), SCSS 
* **Back**: Scala, Python, Postgres, SQL Server, Golang, Linux
* **Tools**: Git, Docker, Vim, R, Latex, XSLT

This site was built with a custom-made template for [Hugo][2]. You can find it [here in my GitHub][github] along with other projects.

## Stalking material

You can take a peek at my reading list via [Twitter][1], stalk me on [Instagram][igram], or take a look at my contributions to [StackOverflow][so].

I also head a small foundation to foster **sustainable building practices** with the aim of strengthening community development, so you might find posts about both of these topics intertwined in my social media.
